## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [T2K research group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/) at [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en) Ghent. Currently, my research focuses on causal machine learning, more specifically finding ways to include causal expert knowledge in deep learning models. I am especially interested in applying these ideas to practical use-cases in healthcare, to improve trustworthiness and interpretability of clinical decision support systems. My research is funded by [FWO Flanders](https://www.fwo.be/en/). In my free time I love to crochet, go to the cinema, dance, read and travel. 

## Research Interests

- **Causal Machine Learning**: causal neural networks, partial causal discovery, causal inference with bayesian networks
- **ML for healthcare**: clinical decision support systems, injection of expert knowledge into ML models
- **Natural Language Processing**: information extraction from unstructured clinical notes
