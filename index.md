## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the [T2K research group](https://ugentt2k.github.io/) at [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en) Ghent. Currently, my research focuses on finding ways to include expert knowledge in deep learning models. I am especially interested in applying these ideas to practical use-cases in healthcare, to improve trustworthiness and interpretability of clinical decision support systems. My research is funded by [FWO Flanders](https://www.fwo.be/en/). In my free time I love to crochet, travel, read and go to the cinema, among many other things. 

## Research Interests

- **ML for healthcare**: clinical decision support systems, injection of expert knowledge into ML models
- **Bayesian networks**: integrate text into Bayesian networks, regularize neural networks with knowledge of causal Bayesian network structure
- **Causal Machine Learning**: causal neural networks, partial causal discovery, causal inference with Bayesian networks
- **Natural Language Processing**: information extraction from unstructured clinical notes 

## Talks
